## Capturing Quake live with OBS

Beforehand, in the NVIDIA control panel:

- Set OBS to high performance mode (GPU).
- Do the same with QL.

Then follow the steps below:

- Make sure OBS isn't running.
- Run QL and load a map or demo.
- When the loading is done, launch OBS and start recording.

Note that OBS will need to be restarted with each map change...

Used OBS capture modes:

- ``` Game capture > Specific Windows > [quakelive_steam.exe]: Quake Live ```
- ``` Audio Output Capture > Default ```
